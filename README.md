# Kaggle_Tabular_playground_Sep22
Kaggle - Tabular playground series

For this challenge, you will be predicting a full year worth of sales for 4 items from two competing stores located in six different countries. This dataset is completely fictional, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. You are given the challenging task of predicting book sales during the year 2021.

Submissions are evaluated on SMAPE between forecasts and actual values. We define SMAPE = 0 when the actual and predicted values are both 0.
